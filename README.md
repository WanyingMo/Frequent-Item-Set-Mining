examples of cross-selling that are frequently used by online retailers. One simple method to give product recommendations is to recommend products that are frequently browsed  together by the customers.
- 2d:Identify pairs of items (X, Y) such that the support of {X, Y} is at least 100. For all such pairs, compute the confidence scores of the corresponding association rules: X ⇒ Y, Y ⇒ X. Sort the rules in decreasing order of confidence scores and list the top 5 rules in the writeup. Break ties, if any, by lexicographically increasing order on the left hand side of the rule.
- 2e:Identify item triples (X, Y, Z) such that the support of {X, Y, Z} is at least 100. For all such triples, compute the confidence scores of the corresponding association rules: (X, Y) ⇒ Z, (X, Z) ⇒ Y, and (Y, Z) ⇒ X. Sort the rules in decreasing order of confidence scores and list the top 5 rules in the writeup. Order the left-hand-side pair lexicographically and break ties, if any, by lexicographical order of the first then the second item in the pair.
